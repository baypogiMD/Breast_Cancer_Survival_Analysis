# Breast Cancer Survival Analysis (SQL + Python)

## 📌 Overview
This repository presents an end-to-end clinical data analysis and survival modeling pipeline using a breast cancer dataset of 4,024 patients. The project integrates SQL-based analytics with Python notebooks to extract epidemiological, clinical, and prognostic insights.

The workflow mirrors real-world healthcare analytics practices used in academic research and clinical decision support systems.
